# CS 245 (Spring, 2019) Practice Assignment 05

An error was found on the [quicksort example published on Slack](https://usfcs.slack.com/archives/CFGT9SRDW/p1552095163003500), which I adapted for my code.

The fix was to add an if statement at the end of the code for size 2 arrays or less. Efficiency has decreased by 20%
